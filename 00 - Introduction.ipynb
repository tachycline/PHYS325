    "Welcome to this brief introduction to the Jupyter (formerly IPython) notebook. Jupyter is an interactive environment for a number of programming languages, including Python.  The notebook is one of several possible ways to interact with Python; it has many nice features, and so it is where we will focus our attention.  This document was developed for use in upper level physics classes at Marietta College. It is designed to help students with no prior programming experience be able to use Python to solve the kinds of problems we will encounter in class. It does not come close to exploring everything you can do with either the Jupyter notebook or the Python programming language.  If you want more information about either of those things, I would direct you toward the official documentation for the [Jupyter Project](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.org) or [Python](http://python.readthedocs.org). As of this writing (January 2016) Python 3 is mature, stable, and well supported. There are some libraries that still don't support it, but it is what we will use.\n",
